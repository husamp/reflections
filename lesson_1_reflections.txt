I could easily see the differences between my first file and second file.
Also, I only saw the differences between 2 files and made my job way easier.
Thanks to that, I was able to spot the typo and fix it easily.

I can easily see the changes that I have done throughout the time. 
This helps me to see which changes I have introduced. It also helps me
to revoke any older version if I happen to make any critical mistake.

I think if I do it manually, I can decide better when it makes sense to commit.
That would make it easier to compare different commits and not make my history
too big. On the other hand, it is very likely to forget to commit for a while and 
then it can be too late to restore to an older version or make comparisons.

It is because Google Docs works in a single file, and designed and developed
for tracking the changes in a single file. Whereas git was developed for software 
projects with multiple files.

Git log gives me a comprehensive list of all the commits I have done and the summary
for each commit. Git diff helps me to compare 2 different commits between each other.

If something is broken, we can easily checkout an older commit and see where the bug was introduced,
and compare with our latest commit.
