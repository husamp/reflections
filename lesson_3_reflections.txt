When would you want to create a remore repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For sharing with other collaborators
For backing up my projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because my remote can be updated by someone else, as well. This way, I can only pull whenever I'd like to, and keep my local repository intact.
